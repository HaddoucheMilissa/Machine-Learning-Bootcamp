# Machine-Learning-Bootcamp
This bootcamp is designed for individuals who aspire to learn machine learning but are not yet proficient in Python. Therefore, participants will start by mastering the *fundamentals of Python*, including :

**variables, functions, operations, and other essential concepts.**

Following this, we will progress to more advanced topics such as : 

**built-in functions, object-oriented programming and complex libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn**

ensuring that participants have a comprehensive understanding of all necessary programming concepts.

In the final phase, we will delve into the core of ***machine learning***. This will cover:

**data analysis, making predictions, and building custom models**, equipping participants with the skills needed to excel in the field of machine learning.
