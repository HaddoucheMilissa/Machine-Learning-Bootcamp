# Machine-Learning-Bootcamp
This bootcamp is designed for individuals who aspire to learn machine learning but are not yet proficient in Python. Therefore, participants will start by mastering the fundamentals of Python, including variables, functions, operations, and other essential concepts.

Following this, we will progress to more advanced topics such as built-in functions and object-oriented programming, ensuring that participants have a comprehensive understanding of all necessary programming concepts.

In the final phase, we will delve into the core of machine learning. This will cover data analysis, making predictions, and building custom models, equipping participants with the skills needed to excel in the field of machine learning.
